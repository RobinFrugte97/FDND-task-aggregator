## Features

### Svelte

This project is made in the framework [Svelte](https://www.svelte.dev). Svelte is different from other frameworks.
Where other frameworks like React and Vue do their work in the browser, Svelte does its work in the build-stage of the project. Svelte can be viewed as a compiler. Instead of using a virtual DOM like most frameworks, Svelte writes code to update the dom whenever the state of the application changes.

### Searchbar

You can search for specific tasks based on a couple of things:
- Task name
- Sprint name
- Semester name
- Any tag

Results are automatically displayed on user input.

### Datalist

Whilst typing, you are presented with suggestions using the html `<datalist>` element. The options inside the datalist are dynamicly calculated based on user input.

### Sorting

The tasks can be sorted based on `task-order` and `alphabetical-order`.

Sorting based on difficulty and the sorting interface are work-in-progress.

The default sorting is based on `task-order`.
